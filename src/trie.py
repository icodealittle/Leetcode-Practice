"""
There is one root node in each Trie
Each node of a Trie represents a string and each edge represents a character.
Every node consists of hashmaps or an array of pointers, with each index
representing a character and a flag to indicate if any string ends at the current node.

        Define a function insert(TrieNode *root, string &word) which will take two

        Now take another pointer currentNode and initialize it with the root node.

        Iterate over the length of the given string and check if the value is NULL or
        not in the array of pointers at the current character of the string.
        If Itâ€™s NULL then, make a new node and point the current character to this newly created node.
        Move the curr to the newly created node.
        Finally, increment the wordCount of the last currentNode, this implies that there is a string ending currentNode
